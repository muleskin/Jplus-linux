// They have to be here too: in development the pages come from Vite, not
// from the API port, and OriginGuard trusts an Origin of localhost:5173. A
// hostile page that iframes this dev server and harvests a click gets a
// proxied POST carrying that trusted Origin -- the exact exploit the guard
// exists to stop, routed around it. Proxied /api responses already carry
// these from JARVIS; the HTML itself did not.
