/**
 * The Sessions view: master-detail. The list of every Claude Code
 * conversation on the left, and one conversation's answer beside it.
 *
 * THE QUESTION THIS VIEW EXISTS TO ANSWER is "does this want me, and why?".
 * So the detail panel opens with that answer and nothing else: a callout
 * carrying the state in words, and — when a session is blocked — the reason
 * verbatim, in the largest type on the panel. Everything below it (what it is
 * working on, how long, what it dispatched, where it lives) is context for
 * that one sentence.
 *
 * LAYOUT. `splitView` — the same master-detail primitive Projects and Specs
 * use, so this is not a third arrangement. Both columns are always in the
 * grid: selecting a session swaps the right column's contents and never moves
 * the list, because the list is a live monitor and a list that reflows under
 * the cursor is unusable exactly while you are working down it. On a narrow
 * window the detail becomes a right-hand sheet over a scrim; Escape, the
 * Close control, the scrim and re-clicking the open row all dismiss it.
 *
 * TWO CLOCKS, NEVER ONE. `since` is when the CURRENT STATE began; `started`
 * is when the conversation began. Measured on the live roster they were 102
 * HOURS apart. They are labelled separately and never substituted.
 *
 * `title`, `summary`, `last_prompt`, `last_text`, `needs`, subagent
 * descriptions and project names all come out of other people's transcripts
 * and are attacker-influenced — every one of them reaches the DOM through
 * textContent, never innerHTML. That is the whole reason for the rule.
